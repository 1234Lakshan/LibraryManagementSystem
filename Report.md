**Library Management System - Version Control Report - Group No 16**

**Overview**
This report summarizes the work we did as a group to manage and version-control our Library Management System class diagram using Git and GitHub. 
It covers the tasks we completed, the challenges we faced, and what we learned from the experience.

=> What We Did

**Setting Up the Project**
We started by creating a folder 'LibraryManagementSystem' and initializing it as a Git repository.
The class diagram was saved in a 'Diagrams' folder as a png, and we wrote a brief description of the project in a README.md file.
Everything was committed and pushed to GitHub so the team could work collaboratively.

**Team Contributions**
Each member cloned the repository and added their name to the Contributors section in the README.
We also worked on improving the class diagram by adding new relationships and making it more accurate for a library management system.

**Working with Branches**
Before making any changes, we created a new branch called 'update-class-diagram' to avoid disrupting the main branch.
Once the updates were made, the changes were committed and pushed to the branch.
A pull request was opened, and reviewed the changes before merging them into the main branch.

**Handling Conflicts**
To practice resolving conflicts, two of us edited the same part of the README file on different branches.
When we tried to merge the branches, Git flagged a conflict. We resolved it by editing the conflicting file locally, saving the changes, and completing the merge.

**Final Touches**
Once everything was merged, we made sure the class diagram and README file were up-to-date and pulled the latest changes so everyone had the final version.

=> Challenges We Faced

**Learning Git**
Some of us were new to Git, so it took time to understand commands like branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

**Merge Conflicts**
Resolving conflicts was tricky at first, but with some practice, we got the hang of it.

**Team Coordination**
Making sure everyone worked on their own branch and didn’t overwrite each other’s changes required clear communication and planning.

=> What We Learned

**Using Git Effectively**
We now understand how to set up and use a Git repository, work with branches, and push changes to a remote repository.

**Pull Requests and Code Reviews**
Pull requests are a great way to review changes before merging, and they helped us maintain a smooth workflow.

**Resolving Conflicts**
Resolving merge conflicts showed us how important it is to communicate and keep our work organized.

**Best Practices for Collaboration**
We learned to write clear commit messages, pull changes regularly, and stay organized to avoid unnecessary conflicts.

**Conclusion**
This project was a great hands-on experience in working with version control systems like Git and GitHub. 
We now feel more confident collaborating on code, managing changes, and resolving conflicts. These skills will definitely help us in future projects!
